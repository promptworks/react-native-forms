The texture can just be<br>re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
